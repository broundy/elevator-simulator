## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

Elevator Simulator Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/broundy/elevator-simulator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/broundy/elevator-simulator)

Project to demonstrate an elevator simulator.

### ToDo List

- [ ] Add comments for clarity
- [ ] Add many more cases for edge conditions. I only added the required ones.
- [ ] Simulator needs to show that elevators are not instantaneous.  My elevators are more like transporters.
