## Elevator Simulator Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/broundy/elevator-simulator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/broundy/elevator-simulator)

Project to demonstrate an elevator simulator.

gradle run -PappArgs="['25', '2']" from a command line.  The first arg is the floors and the second is the elevators.

The original assignment was complete at about 2pm.  I spent another hour cleaning up that night.

This will let you browse at the 2 hour deadline if that is important:

### ToDo List

- [ ] Add comments for clarity
- [ ] Add many more cases for edge conditions. I only added the required ones.
- [x] Simulator needs to show that elevators are not instantaneous.  My elevators are more like transporters.
